White Nina
===

Hi. I'm a simple and beautiful theme called White Nina. I'm a theme meant for blogging and personal sites. Try me into the next, most awesome, WordPress site out there. That's what I'm here for.

My ultra-minimal CSS might make me look like theme tartare but that means less stuff to get in your way when you're creating your awesome site. Here are some of the other more interesting things you'll find here:

* Basic general templates.
* Two sidebars, one for blog and another for pages.
* Smartly organized lightweight CSS.
* Licensed under GPLv2 or later.
* Mobile friendly main menu
* Sleek design of default Gutenberg blocks
* Footer Menu
* Social links menu with icons
